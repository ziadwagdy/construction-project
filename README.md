# To play the guessing game, there are five options in the main menu. 
    1.	Guessing a number
    2.	Guessing an alphabet
    3.	Getting the high score
    4.	Credits 
    5.	Exit 

    If you select option 1 you will have to guess a number, if you select option 2 you will have to guess an alphabet. You must select the game's difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) for either of the selected numbers 1 or 2. The program will provide you with instructions once you have made your choice. After that, you may start guessing. For every level of difficulty, there are permitted chances. You win if your guess is correct. Even if you make a wrong guess, you can keep playing until you run out of chances. If you enter option 3 from the main menu the program will prompt your high score of both the number and the alphabet guessing game. If you enter option 4, the system will prompt the credits and if you select option 5, the game will end.
